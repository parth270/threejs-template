        para:`It was late in the afternoon in May 2008 on a
        rare sunny day in Vancouver, British
        Columbia. Incoming lululemon CEO Christine
        Day looked out at the Coast Mountain range
        from her office and, despite the blue skies,
        sensed a mammoth storm brewing.
        Day, who spent 20 years climbing the
        leadership ranks at Starbucks, joined
        lululemon as SVP of Retail in January 2008. It
        was a time of meteoric growth and expansion
        for lululemon, founded in 1998 as a specialty
        retailer that designs, manufactures, and sells
        “yoga-inspired athletic apparel.” In 2005,
        lululemon was a privately held $40 million
        entrepreneurial startup with less than 20
        stores in Canada. As Day prepared to step
        into the CEO role in mid 2008, lululemon was
        a publicly traded $350 million company with
        close to 100 stores, including 56 in the
        United States, and nearly 3000 employees.
        The directive from the board was to continue
        the company’s growth trajectory, by opening
        more stores and increasing sales to $1 billion.
        The company was also poised to launch an
        eCommerce operation`,

        para:`Lululemon grew into a leading-edge sports
        apparel retailer from relatively humble
        aspirations. Chip Wilson founded the
        company after running a surf, skate, and
        snowboard apparel company for 20 years,
        an endeavor that had him crisscrossing
        Canada, Japan, and Europe.
        When Chip began taking yoga classes in
        the late 1990’s, he observed that the
        “cotton clothing being used for sweaty,
        stretchy power yoga seemed completely
        inappropriate.” Chip parlayed his passion
        for technical athletic fabrics into a small
        apparel design workshop that transformed
        into a yoga studio at night to help pay the
        rent. His goal was to run one store in the
        Vancouver neighborhood where he lived,
        with personal lifestyle considerations his
        primary motivation.

        its mission as creating “components for
        people to live longer, healthier, more fun

        leadership team looked to the future, they
        were mindful of the past and the lessons
        learned during their first major expansion.
        Perhaps the most significant growing pains
        involved the cultural shift that came with
        the hiring of Former Reebok Chairman Bob
        Meers as CEO, who in turn brought in

        para:`When Christine Day took over as CEO in
        June 2008, her mandate was to continue
        lululemon’s growth trajectory and ultimately
        build a billion dollar company. At the same
        time, however, Day couldn’t shake her sense
        of impending doom. “The swells were
        building, and I realized we were on pretty
        shaky ground,
        ” she reflected.
        In a macro environment characterized by
        decreasing consumer confidence and
        growing uncertainties in global markets, Day
        faced a number of complex challenges. Even
        as lululemon continued to open stores, sales
        per square foot dropped from $1,710 in FY07
        to $1,451 in FY08, while increases in comp
        store sales dropped from 24% to 3%.
        Lululemon was plagued by persistent
        inventory problems and real estate issues in
        the United States. Moreover, the company’s
        leadership team was demoralized and
        fragmented.
        In determining her initial steps as CEO, Day
        ultimately had to decide what actions to take
        (and not take) to better execute lululemon’s
        strategy, as well as how to engage both her
        senior team and the larger organization.`
